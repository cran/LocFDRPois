Description: The main idea of the Local FDR algorithm is to estimate both proportion of null observations and the ratio of null and alternative densities. In the case that there are many null observations, this can be done reliably, through maximum likelihood or generalized linear models. This package implements this in the case that the null and alternative densities are Poisson.
